    "The Problem\n",
    "-------------------------\n",
    "Suppose you have N jobs and M machines. Each job consists in M operations on each machine. The i-th operation is executed on the i-th machine and each operation could start only if the previous have already finished. Jobs can be executed in any order. Jobs order could differ depending on machine. The problem is to find optimal solution, i.e. that one with the minimal makespan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem overview\n",
    "-------------------------\n",
    "The problem is P-hard only for the case when M = 2. Then it's exactly solved by the Johnson's algorithm. The work is dedicated to the case when M > 2, and, moreover, order of jobs on machines could differ. There are several works on the problem, but most of them solves permutation problem, when order on machines remains the same. Our goal is to find an evolutionary approach to the general flow shop problem. \n",
